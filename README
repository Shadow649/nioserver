This is a simple implementation of a MT server using java NIO
The idea is to build a pluggable server who can serve different type of application.
There are two module
1) httpmodule contains a raw implementation of a http server. It accept only get method server by a FileBased resource finder. But it's possible to implement a different type of resourcefinder.

2) echomodule contains a simple echoserver.

Instruction to build
From parent type mvn clean package

Instruction to start applications
1)Httpserver after package (or install) you can start the server by typing 
java -jar httpmodule/target/http-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar [port]
or better
sh httpmodule/target/appassembler/bin/server [port]

2)Echoserver the same
java -jar echomodule/target/echomodule-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar [port]
sh echomodule/target/appassembler/bin/echoserver [port]

Instruction for usage
1)Httpserver have a preconfigured set of resources you can add simply typing in your browser http://127.0.0.1:8080/
The root directory is httpmodule/root/

2)Echoserver can be tested with any client capable to open a socket write and read it.
for example telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
type you message followed by "end"

This is a prototype and it lacks:
proper logging configuration
is not configurable now are hardcoded with default configuration
cache
support of cookies ecc ecc
